Average Mark Calculation

Languages: Python

Topics: OOP, Basic, Error handling

''' This is my very first programming mini project with python and these codes are very basic and primary.'''
Program is basically a faster way for university students to calculate their final semester average mark. first each X modular lessons count is taken from user and after that, each of those X modular lessons has to be inserted from user.
'Version.1' series only supports from one modular lessons till four modular lesson.
finally if student mark is 12 or bellow, output will be red and different. if student mark is 17 or above, output will be green and different. otherwise, output color will be blue.

Note: Codes documentation and descriptions is more obvious in comments among the codes on each file.
